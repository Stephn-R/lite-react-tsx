# Lite React TSX Web App

#### Getting Started for development

1. Install Modules

```sh
npm install
```

2. Run the app in development mode

```sh
npm run develop
```

3. **OR** Run the app in production mode

```sh
npm start
```

#### Debugging React using VSCode

1. To debug using Chrome Debugging in VS Code, you will need to execute the following commands in seperate terminal instances:

> npm run develop

> npm run launch:chrome:debug

*each one of these will trigger a watching process*

2. Then step into the debugging suite for VS Code and execute the debug task named `Attach Chrome Debugging`.

3. Lastly, navigate to [Localhost at port 8000](http://localhost:8000) to begin debugging.

*If your lite-server is set to a different port, specify that port above instead*
